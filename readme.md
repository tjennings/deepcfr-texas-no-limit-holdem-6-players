Due to the success of this project, I'm committing more time and attention to further development. I've outlined two key initiatives:

1. **Release Schedule**: I'll be publishing regular updates with new features and improvements.
   - v2.1 (April 2025): ✅ Fixed bet calculation for stable training, ✅ Implemented opponent modeling capabilities, Expanded bet sizing options and performance optimizations, Advanced architectures and training methods
   - v2.2 (June 2025): Web interface for playing against the AI, API Endpoints for integration, Export to ONNX format for deployment

2. **Feature Roadmap**: I've created a comprehensive [checklist of upcoming features](./FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md) that I plan to implement, including model architecture enhancements, training improvements, and advanced techniques.

I welcome contributions and feedback from the community as this project continues to evolve!

A deep learning implementation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) for No-Limit Texas Hold'em Poker. This project demonstrates advanced reinforcement learning techniques applied to imperfect information games.

> **Note:** This project builds on the straightforward and flexible [Pokers](https://github.com/Reinforcement-Poker/pokers) environment—a minimalistic no-limit Texas Hold'em simulator designed for reinforcement learning. Pokers cuts out the fuss by using a simple `new_state = state + action` model, making it really easy to integrate with any framework. While its simplicity is a major plus, it's also a side project that might have some bugs in less-tested areas. If you need rock-solid reliability, you might consider alternatives like RLCard. Huge thanks to the creators of Pokers for their innovative and accessible work!

## Introduction: Why Poker AI Matters

Poker represents one of the greatest challenges in artificial intelligence—a game of incomplete information where players must make decisions without knowing all the relevant facts. Unlike chess or Go, where all information is visible to both players, poker requires reasoning under uncertainty, risk assessment, opponent modeling, and strategic deception.
This project implements Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization (Deep CFR), a cutting-edge algorithm that has revolutionized how AI approaches imperfect information games. By building a poker AI that can compete at a high level, we're developing capabilities that transfer to numerous real-world scenarios:

## Real-World Applications

- **Financial Trading**: Making investment decisions under market uncertainty with incomplete information  
- **Healthcare**: Treatment planning with uncertain patient outcomes and incomplete medical history  
- **Cybersecurity**: Defending systems when attacker capabilities and targets are unknown  
- **Business Negotiation**: Strategic decision-making when counterparty intentions are hidden  
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizing distribution under uncertainty (emergency services, supply chain)  
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Decision-making in dynamic traffic environments with unpredictable human behavior  

## Overview

This repository implements Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization (Deep CFR), an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm for solving imperfect information games. The implementation focuses on No-Limit Texas Hold'em Poker, one of the most challenging games for AI due to:

- Hidden information (opponents' cards)
- Stochastic elements (card dealing)
- Sequential decision-making
- Large state and action spaces

The agent learns by playing against random opponents, specialized opponents via opponent modeling, and self-play, using neural networks to approximate regret values and optimal strategies.

## Architecture

The implementation consists of four main components:

1. **Model Architecture** (`model.py`)
   - Neural network definition
   - State encoding/representation
   - Forward pass implementation

2. **Deep CFR Agent** (`deep_cfr.py`) 
   - Advantage network for regret estimation
   - Strategy network for action selection
   - Memory buffers for experience storage
   - CFR traversal implementation
   - Training procedures

3. **Opponent Modeling** (`opponent_modeling/`)
   - RNN-based action history encoding
   - Opponent tendency prediction
   - Adaptive strategy selection
   - Behavioral pattern exploitation

4. **Training Pipeline** (`training/`)
   - Basic training implementation (against random agents)
   - Self-play training (against checkpoints)
   - Mixed training (against pools of agents)
   - Opponent modeling training variants
   - Metrics tracking and logging
   - Model checkpointing and saving

## Technical Implementation

### Neural Networks

The project uses PyTorch to implement:

- **Advantage Network**: Predicts counterfactual regrets for each action
- **Strategy Network**: Outputs a probability distribution over actions
- **Opponent History Encoder**: RNN-based network that processes opponent action sequences
- **Opponent Model**: Predicts opponent tendencies based on encoded history

The architecture includes:
- Fully connected layers with ReLU activations for advantage and strategy
- GRU-based sequence processing for opponent history encoding
- Enhanced networks with opponent feature integration
- Input size determined by state encoding (cards, bets, game state)
- Output size matching the action space

### Opponent Modeling

The opponent modeling system includes:
- **Action History Tracking**: Records sequences of actions by each opponent
- **Context-Aware Encoding**: Pairs actions with game state contexts
- **RNN-Based Processing**: Uses recurrent networks to identify patterns in play
- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Modifies the agent's strategy based on opponent tendencies
- **Separate Models Per Opponent**: Maintains individualized models for different opponents

### State Representation

Game states are encoded as fixed-length vectors that capture:
- Player hole cards (52 dimensions for card presence)
- Community cards (52 dimensions)
- Game stage (5 dimensions for preflop, flop, turn, river, showdown)
- Pot size (normalized)
- Player positions and button
- Current player
- Player states (active status, bets, chips)
- Legal actions
- Previous actions

### Action Space

The agent can select from four strategic actions:
- Fold
- Check/Call
- Raise 0.5x pot
- Raise 1x pot

### Counterfactual Regret Minimization

The implementation uses external sampling Monte Carlo CFR:
- Regret values are used to guide exploration
- Strategy improvement over iterations
- Regret matching for action selection
- Importance sampling for efficient learning

### Training Process

The training procedure includes:
- Data generation through game tree traversal
- Experience collection in memory buffers
- Regular network updates
- Periodic strategy network training
- Opponent modeling updates
- Regular evaluation against random and model opponents
- Progress tracking via TensorBoard

## Performance Optimizations

The implementation includes various optimizations:
- **Gradient clipping** to prevent exploding gradients
- **Huber loss** for robust learning with outliers
- **Regret normalization and clipping**
- **Linear CFR weighting** for faster convergence
- **Efficient memory management**
- **Fixed bet calculation** for stable training
- **Enhanced error handling and monitoring**

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended package manager)
- PyTorch 2.5+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorBoard
- [Pokers](https://github.com/Reinforcement-Poker/pokers) ("Embarrassingly simple" poker environment from Bruno Santidrian and
Betagmr)

## Future Work

- Expand the action space with more bet sizing options

- Parallel data generation for faster training
- Develop a more diverse set of evaluation opponents
- Enhanced opponent clustering for group-based modeling
- Meta-learning approaches for faster adaptation
